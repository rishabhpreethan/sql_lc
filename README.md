| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

```sql
select visits.customer_id, count(visits.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from visits
left join transactions on visits.visit_id=transactions.visit_id
where transactions.transaction_id is null
group by visits.customer_id;

| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

Output: 

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

```sql
select A.id 
from weather A, weather B
where datediff(A.recordDate,B.recordDate) = 1
and A.temperature > B.temperature;
```
<br>



### 1661
##### Average Time Of Process Per Machine

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write an SQL query to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input:

Activity table:
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

Output: 
| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

```sql
select machine_id, 
round(sum(case when activity_type = 'start' then -1*timestamp else timestamp end)/count(distinct process_id),3) as processing_time
from activity
group by machine_id;
```

| user_id | confirmation_rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |

Explanation:
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

```sql
select user_id,round(avg(if(action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) as confirmation_rate
FROM Signups left join Confirmations using(user_id)
group by 1
order by 1;
```

## Basic Aggregate Functions

### 620
##### Not Boring Movies

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
The query result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input:

Cinema table:
| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

Output: 
| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

```sql
select * from cinema
where id%2!=0 and description!="boring"
order by rating desc;
```
<br>



### 1251
##### Average Selling Price

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input:

Prices table:
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |

UnitsSold table:
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |

Output: 
| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

```sql
select prices.product_id, ROUND(SUM(price * units) / SUM(units), 2) as average_price
from Prices join UnitsSold 
on prices.product_id = unitssold.product_id
and purchase_date between start_date and end_date
group by product_id;
```

+------+
| null |

Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

```sql
select max(a.num) as num
from (select num from mynumbers group by num having count(*)=1) as a;
```
